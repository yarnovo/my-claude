**Business Narrative**

Date: 04/03/2024

To whom it may concern:

I have been in the construction fields for over 20 years. I have a very good reputation for building very high-quality homes, renovations, ADU addition and any remodeling mainly in Santa Cruz and Monterey County. I started Wang Construction back in 2018. Wang Construction is a general contractor which communicate with clients and work with many other sub-contractors, architect, engineers, and vendors to organizing and implementing construction projects from start to end. The company also handles all permit processes with all the city departments to ensure all work is done properly. My goal is to deliver the best construction results, smooth and stress-free experience for my clients.

With the housing needs in California, I am working with stable client pool from real estate investors, who frequently acquire residential units for renovation, demolish/new construction addition per SB9 law. I am also working with individual homeowners to help with their needs.
